# Hobby-SP1

The project Hobby-SP1 is about making a working platform for like-minded individuals/ individuals with similar interest in hobbies.  
This would mean the users of this platform can search to find people with the same hobbies as them or people with hobbies they are getting into.  
This platform will help the users meet people and create communities around their interests.

The group started with setting up a GitHub repository while brainstorming what the project was going to be about and which classes to set up first and what we needed in each class.  
The first thing to be set up was a maven GitHub project and then a KanBan board project in GitHub so while group members where waiting on the structure of the project to be pushed they started adding all the issues they could think of at the moment  
Once the project was set up each group member assigned themselves to an issues and started coding, entity classes were the first to be made as the project would be hard to code without them.  
Day 1: Alexander set up GitHub repository, project and structure. Tobias went through a basic project model on a white board and discussed what each class needs to entail. David started setting up all other basic classes than entity classes (as they were all being worked on by the other members)  
Day 2 and onward consist of members assigning themselves to issues and following the UserStories/ testing their methods.  
All requirements are fulfilled and most optional requirements are completed.
